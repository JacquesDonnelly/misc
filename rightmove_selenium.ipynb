The entrance vestibule opens to the hall, a welcoming space where one is immediately aware of the elegance of this fine house. The sitting room/library has windows on two aspects filling this lovely fully panelled room with light; fitted bookshelves are mirrored either side of the fireplace.\n",

    "Facing virtually due south, the drawing room is the perfect place for a family gathering. With generous open fireplaces at each end, the room can be used as a more intimate space or opened up to enjoy its fullest extent. A door from here leads directly to the terrace. To the eastern end there is access to the study and to the opposite end a door opens into the snug (currently used as a playroom), which in turn leads into the orangery style dining room. With windows on three sides the dining room enjoys views over the garden - on a sunny day, with the doors opening to the garden, this is the perfect spot for informal entertaining.\n",

The house is set on slightly raised ground and stands proud of the gardens, which are laid out as a series of rooms, with tall mature beech hedges giving structure and form. Wide expanses of lawn are interspersed with specimen trees. To the west of the house are more formal gardens with wide herbaceous beds backed by profusely flowering climbing and rambling roses. A York stone terrace runs the width of the house and has central steps down to the lower lawn area.\n",

A glazed roof covered with a mature vine gives an air of Mediterranean calm and the perfect spot for long lazy lunches. Immediately adjoining is an outdoor cooking area with a brick built barbecue and an Italian pizza oven, which is built into the former stable block. The main entertaining room has a wood burning stove and stairs to a mezzanine level. Adjoining are two further store rooms.\n",
